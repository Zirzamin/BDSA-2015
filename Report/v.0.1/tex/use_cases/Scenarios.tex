		   \item As soon as Alice turns on the program she immediately sees that she has been assigned for screening for the wave study.
		   \item Alice reads up on what the review wants her to do, this time she has to go through a list of 51 articles and look for relevant papers that match the topic of harnessing electricity from waves. The articles she find corresponding with the topic she marks off.
		   \item At 4 pm Alice has a appointment so she shuts down her pc and decides to finish reviewing the last 9 papers tomorrow.
